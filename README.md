# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier with Grad-CAM Visualizations

This project implements an image classification model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch and ResNet18. The model is served through a Gradio web interface and visualized with Grad-CAM heatmaps for model explainability.

A live demo of the project is available on Hugging Face Spaces:

## Model Overview

- Architecture: ResNet18 (pre-trained)
- Dataset: CIFAR-10
  (Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
- Training Epochs: 10
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 1e-3
- Device: CPU/GPU (PyTorch auto-detection)

Grad-CAM is integrated for visual explanations of model predictions.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Training

Training was executed over 10 epochs with progressive improvements in validation accuracy:

Epoch 1 : Accuracy = 57.28%
Epoch 2 : Accuracy = 68.96%
Epoch 3 : Accuracy = 70.68%
Epoch 4 : Accuracy = 72.18%
Epoch 5 : Accuracy = 75.00%
Epoch 6 : Accuracy = 75.94%
Epoch 7 : Accuracy = 79.70%
Epoch 8 : Accuracy = 81.20%
Epoch 9 : Accuracy = 83.10%
Epoch 10: Accuracy = 83.80%

The best model (83.80% accuracy) was saved at the end of training.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Evaluation

Test Accuracy: 84.02%  
Macro Average F1-Score: 0.84  

Per-class performance:

Class        | Precision | Recall | F1-Score
-------------|-----------|--------|---------
airplane     | 0.81      | 0.89   | 0.85
automobile   | 0.90      | 0.93   | 0.92
bird         | 0.85      | 0.75   | 0.80
cat          | 0.77      | 0.62   | 0.68
deer         | 0.83      | 0.83   | 0.83
dog          | 0.78      | 0.73   | 0.75
frog         | 0.84      | 0.93   | 0.88
horse        | 0.83      | 0.91   | 0.87
ship         | 0.93      | 0.90   | 0.91
truck        | 0.85      | 0.92   | 0.88

- Confusion matrix shows strong diagonal dominance, indicating accurate classification across most classes.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Grad-CAM Visualizations

- Grad-CAM heatmaps were generated for five random test images.
- Heatmaps consistently highlighted object regions (e.g., catâ€™s face, shipâ€™s hull).
- Visual overlays confirmed predictions were based on relevant regions.
- Grad-CAM overlays are saved as downloadable PNG files within the app and in /outputs/interpretations/.

In the deployed Gradio app:
- Top-3 predictions and probabilities are displayed.
- The most confident (Top-1) prediction is displayed in a Label component.
